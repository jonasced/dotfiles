This config is made for the US keyboard layout and changes:
- Enable Swedish typing while keeping symbols on US keyboard locations
- Caps Lock to act as Escape on quick tap, but if held, it will act as Left Ctrl.
- Backtick/grave key to act as backtick/grave on quick tap,
but change hjkl keys to arrow keys vi style on hold.
- Some extra fun stuff

This text between the two pipe+octothorpe sequences is a multi-line comment.

;; Text after double-semicolons are single-line comments.

One defcfg entry may be added, which is used for configuration key-pairs. These
configurations change kanata's behaviour at a more global level than the other
configuration entries.

  This configuration will process all keys pressed inside of kanata, even if
  they are not mapped in defsrc. This is so that certain actions can activate
  at the right time for certain input sequences. By default, unmapped keys are
  not processed through kanata due to a Windows issue related to AltGr. If you
  use AltGr in your keyboard, you will likely want to follow the simple.kbd
  file while unmapping lctl and ralt from defsrc.
